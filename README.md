# University-Network_And_Computer_Security

Repository that contains the files of the project developed during the **Network and Computer Security** class, performed in the 1st year of my MSc in Computer Science at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.

It is a 2FA implementation:
- The web folder contains a web app that allows users to register and authenticate
- The mobile folder contains a mobile app that allows users to scan a QR code containing the 2FA secret
